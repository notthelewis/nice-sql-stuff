It has came to light that stored sql procedures are a more efficient way of handling scripted sql. 
In lieu of this, I'm gonna re work the logic for the nds tool... 

This is going to COMPLETELY restructure the 2queryMagic.py file. 

I originally used a for loop in python to match the IPs with domain names

```
  ips_low_latency, hosts_low, lat_low = [], [], []

  for i,x,y in ip_ll:
      cursorA.execute("SELECT domain FROM pytest.nodes2 WHERE ip = '" + str(i) + "'")
      hosts_low.append(cursorA.fetchone())
      ips_low_latency.append(i)
      lat_low.append(x)

  return zip(ips_low_latency, hosts_low, lat_low)
```

This is going to be completely restructured using:

CREATE PROCEDURE domSel(IN xip VARCHAR(16)) SELECT domain FROM pytest.nodes2 WHERE ip = xip
